GBNC Sessions
=============

A place for speakers to document and discuss their talk topics for the Great British Node Conference


## How it works

All speakers are given commit access to the repo

Add a markdown file named something like `my-talk-title.md` and add your abstract to the file, with any relevant links and things you will need for presenting, i.e. table, handsfree mic, fleet of flying robots etc

Comment on other speakers abstracts if you like, maybe suggesting some things they could include.

## Got questions for the organisers?

Open an issue or email: andrewnez@gmail.com

Feedback on this approach to introducing speakers to each other before hand and collabroating on the abstracts very welcome.
