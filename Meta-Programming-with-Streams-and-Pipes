# Meta Programming with Streams and Pipes

EEP (windowed events) and Beam (CEP-like streams and pipes) will be getting update(s)
soon and taking on some meta just in time for GBNC. There will be demo's. Demo's will
integrate with hardware.

## Needs

Power for 2 or 3 USB-powered devices that I'll bring (Raspberry Pi, Arduino, Makey Makey, Leap, 1-metre long 'thing').
Loan of an AR Drone
A table - to put a Robosapiens v1 (perhaps v2 too) and a '1 metre long device' on.
